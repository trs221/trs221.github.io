			<h2>Hello!</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Tim Shiner. I am an aspiring software engineer and member of Army ROTC. 
				I am currently finishing my BSCS degree to commission in the US Army Cyber Corps as an officer in December of 2024.
				In the meantime, I am working to learn as much as I possibly can about SWE, Cybersecurity, and leadership.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of work, I enjoy everything cars and motorcycles, backpacking, rappelling, and working out.
			</p>
